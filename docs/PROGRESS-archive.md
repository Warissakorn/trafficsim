# PROGRESS archive — TrafficSim

Entries moved whole out of [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) to keep it inside the 500-line budget
(hard rule 6). Nothing here is edited or summarised — only relocated. Newest first.

The `Next` section, the backlog, the open questions and the decision table all stay in
`PROGRESS.md`; this file is log entries only.

### 2026-09-12 — native editor M1.1–M1.3 implemented (D16)

Added a version-1 ProjectDocument and a Qt-free command library. Every committed edit
validates a candidate before publishing it; a failed edit preserves both history and
the model. Undo/Redo keeps up to 100 document snapshots, persists the current revision
and ID counter in project files, and tracks the last saved revision. Embedded PNG data
is shared immutably between snapshots rather than copied for every gesture.

The independent Qt editor is available from the M0 window or `--editor`. It provides
metric grid/snap, pan/zoom/fit, single-link selection, point/link dragging, point insertion
and removal, lane count and individual widths, left/right driving side, opposite
carriageways, split links and an extra downstream pocket lane. Splits introduce a 0.2 m
continuity span with explicit lane connectors and remap existing routes. A link deletion
confirms its affected connectors/heads/routes/inputs and restores all of them on Undo.
Referenced lane removal is rejected. Connector endpoints reanchor on geometry edits.

Local background images are embedded, calibrated from two picked points and a known
real distance, positioned/rotated/scaled and given opacity. All background changes are
undoable. Basic Open/Save/Save As use a versioned JSON document and QSaveFile atomic
replacement; failed load/save preserves the current work. New/Open/Close ask about
unsaved changes. Native prompts and editor controls support English and Thai. The
inspector can be hidden, resized or detached. No new simulation behaviour was added.

Boundary enforcement now also rejects project-to-command/editor/Qt imports, with
negative fixtures. `docs/NETWORK_EDITOR.md` records operation, format and exact limits.
M1.3.1 explicitly tracks the unsupported signal-bearing-link split rather than moving
signal stationing silently. General connectors, tables, recovery and run handoff remain
M1.4–M1.7. Windows/macOS GUI execution and the owner's usability gate remain unverified.

**Verification:** GCC 13.3 / Qt 6.4.2 on Linux. Fresh isolated Debug and Release
builds passed all 13 CTest suites; a separate Qt-free build passed all 11 suites.
The native test executable contains 38 named cases (8 new editor model cases), and
Qt UI checks exercise actual mouse/keyboard drawing, dragging, insertion/removal,
pan/zoom, cancellation, per-lane widths, pockets, opposite carriageways, driving side,
confirmed deletion/Undo, image transforms/two-point calibration, Unicode paths,
failed save/load preservation, unsaved-work cancellation and Thai translation.
The existing four TS regression fixtures, deterministic core replay, CLI and M0
controls still pass. Architecture/negative checks, the 500-line limit and whitespace
checks pass. A Thai editor screenshot at 1000×760 was visually inspected. GUI behaviour
on Windows/macOS and GitHub-hosted runner execution are not claimed verified here.


### 2026-09-11 — native C++ migration implemented (D15)

Replaced the active TypeScript/Vite application with C++20 libraries for core, network,
scenario loading and evaluation, a native CLI, and a Qt 6 Widgets desktop harness.
CMake presets cover desktop, headless and Release. All executable developer checks
are now C++; JSON remains the catalog/locale/fixture format. The original application
is preserved at GitHub commit `70383db6ab884c718baef97a8ab81292fdc9d1b0`.

The port preserves fixed ticks, explicitly sequenced xorshift32 draws, canonical IDs,
source queues, upstream tails, red/amber stops and all unsupported-topology guards.
`SimState` is a value snapshot sharing a detached const scenario. Qt, JSON and I/O stay
outside the core. CLI diagnostics include engine/compiler versions, unfinished counts
and optional JSONL events. M0 fixture loading is read-only, not project persistence.

The Qt harness supports Run/Pause/Step/Reset, seed validation/reset, playback speed,
scenario loading and English/Thai switching. Bundled Noto Sans Thai (unmodified OFL 1.1
font with license) fixes missing Thai glyphs on minimal systems. Desktop file-dialog
paths use native wide paths on Windows. Manual screenshot inspection confirmed Thai
text and a queued crossing scene at 640 pixels wide.

**Verification:** GCC 13.3, Qt 6.4.2, nlohmann/json 3.12.0, CMake 4.4.3 on Linux.
The original 40 tests and production build passed before capture. Native tests include
30 named C++ cases, four frozen TS baseline seeds, full same-build event replay, core
and network safety/validation, strict JSON/seed handling and locale key agreement.
Debug and Release desktop builds passed all 11 CTest suites, including interactive
control actions and an entire desktop run matching CLI/baseline. Headless also built
and passed independently without Qt. Address/undefined-behaviour sanitizer tests passed;
LeakSanitizer was disabled because this container cannot inspect process tasks.
The architecture negative fixtures, 500-line check and `git diff --check` passed.
An installed CLI run from a different working directory found its adjacent data and
reproduced seed 42: 31 completed, 0 active, 0 pending, 0 safety clamps and mean delay
29.249359418430977 seconds. No performance or scientific fidelity claim is made.

Added GitHub Actions definitions for Linux desktop/headless/Release and Windows MSVC
headless builds. Windows desktop execution and macOS deployment have not been tested
in this Linux workspace. See `docs/BUILDING.md`, `docs/MIGRATION.md`, updated architecture,
simulation contracts and `tools/README.md` for setup and precise limitations.

**Status:** M0.1 technical migration checks passed on Linux. Owner M0 plausibility
acceptance remains open. No M1 editor, movement LOS, right-of-way model, calibration
or M7 installer is claimed complete. Next remains owner review, then one undoable link.

### 2026-09-11 — M0 simulation core and network model implemented

The repository previously contained documentation only. Added a strict TypeScript/Vite/
Vitest toolchain and lockfile, the directory skeleton, and an AST-based core dependency
guard that is tested against intentionally invalid imports.

**Network:** link/lane/connector authoring types; left/right driving-side lane geometry;
mid-link signal heads; geometry/reference/range validation; and a detached scenario
compiler. Junctions are not authored, and no second persisted network format was added.

**Core:** fixed timestep; explicit xorshift32 seed state; immutable snapshots and pure
steps; Poisson source arrivals with persistent external queues; reduced four-regime
following; fixed-time red/amber/green signals; route transitions with residual distance;
upstream vehicle-tail occupancy; and a streaming event interface. The final subinterval's
arrivals remain pending instead of disappearing at the run horizon.

**Integration:** a crossing scenario and vehicle/behaviour catalogs in data files; a
passive canvas harness with run/pause/step/reset, playback speed, seed reset and English/
Thai text; a headless CLI; and an explicitly unvalidated completed-trip delay diagnostic.
The engine still has no UI, model, I/O or wall-clock imports.

**Verification:** 40 automated tests cover replay (including a reference trajectory
fingerprint), pure stepping, source queues, conservation, signal timing, free acceleration,
red stops/green discharge, upstream tails, short connectors, invalid scenarios, authoring
geometry and the import boundary. Production type checking/build and the source-size
check pass. A Chromium 152 browser smoke test passed dev boot, single-step, run/pause,
seed reset, Thai translation, an entire run matching the headless output, invalid-seed
handling and a 375-pixel viewport with no horizontal overflow. No page errors occurred.
In a separate clean detached checkout, `npm ci --offline` (using the package cache),
all 40 tests, the production build, the headless example and file-size checks also passed.

**Reference run:** seed 42, 180 simulated seconds, 31 completed trips, 0 active and 0
pending at the horizon, 0 numerical safety clamps. Mean completed-trip delay is
29.249359418430977 s (includes source wait and acceleration, not HCM control delay).
This is a reproducibility fixture, not a capacity or fidelity benchmark.

**Limits remain explicit:** no lane changing, merge arbitration, geometric crossing-conflict
resolution, priority rules, full W74/W99, project persistence, movement LOS or batch
aggregation. Merges, internal inputs and repeated-route segments fail validation.
M0 remains open for the owner's plausibility acceptance. No later milestone was closed.

See D12–D14 and `docs/SIMULATION.md` for the reasoning and precise interfaces.

### 2026-09-11 — reverted to the working name TrafficSim, naming deferred (D11)

Three renames in two days with no code written. The owner called it: go back to the working
name and decide the real one once the program has shape.

Headings across `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and this file are
back to `TrafficSim`, now explicitly marked as a working name so no future session reads it
as settled. D9 and D10 keep their full reasoning and are marked superseded — this file is
append-only, and the collision findings gathered over those rounds are the main thing worth
keeping from them, so they are consolidated into the D11 row. The next naming round starts
from evidence, not from zero.

**Two pieces of queued work are cancelled, not postponed:** the GitHub repository rename (the
repo is still `Warissakorn/trafficsim` and the remote already points there, so there is
nothing to do) and the npm/PyPI/domain registrations for `velk`.

**Two defects in this file were found and fixed while making this change**, both introduced by
earlier sessions of this conversation:

1. **The D10 log entry below was never actually written.** The edit that should have added it
   matched no text, and the guard around that edit only checked that *something* in the file
   had changed — which was true because other edits in the same batch succeeded. It has been
   reconstructed below from the commit message and the D10 row. Guards on edits to this file
   now assert an exact match count per edit.
2. **Entries were in oldest-first order**, contradicting this file's own header. Reordered
   newest-first. No entry text was altered.

Nothing about scope, architecture or the roadmap changed. D1–D8 stand.

### 2026-09-11 — renamed to Velk (D10)

*Reconstructed on 2026-09-11 — see defect 1 in the entry above.*

`Veytrix` replaced throughout the documentation. `velk` verified free on npm and PyPI with no
brand or company found using it; `velk.dev` and `velk.app` free, `velk.com` and `velk.io`
held — ordinary for a four-letter word and irrelevant to a repository or package name, so
accepted as a known risk.

`MicroFlow Simulator` was proposed first this session and dropped after its collision check:
`microflow` taken on npm and PyPI, at least seven GitHub projects carrying the name along
with two orgs and a GitHub Topic, and both obvious domains held. Recorded in D10 so it is not
raised again.

Also noted at the time: the MicroFlow brand write-up claimed "extends to both microscopic and
macroscopic" as a strength, which contradicts `PROBLEM.md` §5 where macroscopic assignment is
a non-goal. **§5 was left unchanged** — that is a scope decision, not a naming one.

### 2026-09-10 — named Veytrix (D9)

Working name `TrafficSim` replaced throughout the documentation. `veytrix` is free on npm
and PyPI; `veytrix.com` is taken and `Vectrix` (electric scooters) is phonetically close —
both recorded in D9 as accepted, known risks rather than discovered later.

**Still to do by hand:** the GitHub repository is still called `trafficsim`. Renaming it needs
repository-admin access, which this session's GitHub app does not have — the owner renames it
in the repository settings, after which the git remote here needs updating.


### 2026-09-10 — Q1 and Q3 answered (D7, D8)

- **Q1 → international from the start** (D7). Consequences recorded: HCM as the default LOS
  pack with jurisdictions as swappable data, metric internally with switchable display units,
  and **left-hand/right-hand traffic as a first-class setting from M1** — added to the M1
  scope in `ROADMAP.md` because retrofitting it touches every geometry routine.
- **Q3 → the project owner performs the M2 gate alone** (D8). Recorded honestly as a
  weakening of the gate, with a mandatory mitigation: the M2 pass/fail criteria must be
  written into `ROADMAP.md` and committed **before** M2 implementation starts. `ROADMAP.md`
  now carries an unfilled placeholder for those criteria; starting M2 without filling it
  voids the gate.
- **Q5 opened:** final product name. `Veytrix` is a placeholder. `Headway` was considered
  and rejected — `headwaymaps/headway` is an existing open-source maps stack, too close a
  neighbour in the same field.

### 2026-09-10 — repository initialized, documentation spine written

Created a fresh repo for a new project, separate from the prior SUMO-wrapper effort.

**Written:** `PROBLEM.md` (who this is for, the engine-level walls that motivate D1, non-goals,
and what would make the project wrong), `PRINCIPLES.md` (hard rules, deliberate non-goals, and
measured discipline inherited from the prior effort), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the five-layer map,
marked planned throughout), `ROADMAP.md` (M0–M7 with done-conditions and two hard gates),
`CLAUDE.md` (standing orders), this file.

**Decisions:** D1–D6 above. D1 is the one everything else rests on, and it has an explicit
falsification test at the M2 gate.

**No code was written.** The Systems table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes intent, not reality;
every row is marked `planned`.

**Next:** toolchain setup — see the `Next` section above.

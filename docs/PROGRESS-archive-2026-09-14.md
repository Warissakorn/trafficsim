### 2026-09-14 — hot path 1/3: route geometry resolved once per run

`routeParts` was recomputed for every vehicle on every tick — 1,867,548 calls in an
8-corridor profile — even though it is a pure function of an immutable `Scenario`. A
`ScenarioIndex` now resolves it once in `createSimulation` and is carried through `SimState`
as a `shared_ptr`, so per-tick state copies share it rather than duplicating it. Routes live
in a contiguous vector, so `partsFor` recovers a route's index from its own address in O(1)
with no extra lookup. The index is built from the **canonical** scenario, so part order
matches the sorted routes.

The uncached `routeParts`, `locateVehicle` and `occupiedSpans` overloads are retained for
`src/render/` and the existing tests; cached and uncached paths share one implementation each
so they cannot drift. `stepSimulation` tolerates a hand-built state without an index by
building one, rather than requiring every caller to change.

**Measured** (Release, GCC 13.3, median of 3, identical commands as the baseline entry above):
600 s of simulation on 1/2/4/8/16/32 corridors went 0.067/0.142/0.488/1.739/4.876/17.724 s to
0.036/0.079/0.285/1.157/3.257/11.327 s, i.e. **-33% to -46%, -36% at 466 vehicles**. The
O(V^1.85) growth is unchanged and is deliberately left to the next slice; this change removes
constant work per call, not the quadratic term.

No behaviour change was intended and none was observed: 12/12 headless CTest including the new
trajectory digest and the exact `29.24935` CLI pin, plus 12 multi-seed multi-size CLI runs
(4 network sizes x 3 seeds) byte-identical to the pre-change binary.

**Verification:** headless preset only. Qt is absent in this container, so the three desktop
suites were not built or run; `src/render/` compiles against the unchanged overloads but no
desktop verification is claimed.

### 2026-09-14 — core hot-path optimization: measurement baseline and trajectory guard

Profiling (Release, GCC 13.3, callgrind) of a synthetic multi-corridor scenario shows engine
cost growing at **O(V^1.85)** in active vehicle count: 466 vehicles take 17.7 s of wall time
for 600 s of simulation. Attribution: `__memcmp_avx2_movbe` 30.9% of all instructions (linear
`detail::byId` searches over `std::string` IDs), `closestVehicle` 39.3% inclusive (nested
`parts x spans` scan, the quadratic term), `routeParts` ~35% inclusive over **1,867,548 calls**
recomputing a value that is constant for an entire run.

Before changing any engine code, per-tick trajectory is now pinned. The four frozen TypeScript
baselines deliberately exclude `MovedEvent`, so positions between the every-100-tick checkpoints
were unguarded. `tests/reference/trajectory-digest.json` records weighted means over the full
`MovedEvent` stream for the same four seeds; means (not sums) keep magnitudes physical so the
existing 1e-7 tolerance applies unchanged, and order/segment/vehicle weights make a reordering
visible that plain sums would hide. The four TypeScript baselines were **not** touched.

The guard was verified non-vacuous: perturbing only the reported position in `locateVehicle`
by 1e-6 relative — which changes `MovedEvent` but not checkpointed `distance` — fails
`meanOrderWeightedPosition` on all four seeds. A 1e-9 relative perturbation of acceleration is
caught by the pre-existing checkpoint comparison. Both perturbations were reverted.

These digests characterize what the engine currently does. They are not a fidelity claim and
do not affect the not-yet-validated marker or any milestone gate.

**Verification:** headless preset, 12/12 CTest. Qt is not installed in this container, so the
three desktop suites were not built or run and no desktop verification is claimed.


### 2026-09-14 — CI packaging workflow for testable binaries

Added `.github/workflows/package.yml`, a manually dispatched (`workflow_dispatch`) and
`v*`-tag workflow that builds, tests and uploads runnable binaries so the owner can try a
build without a local toolchain. Linux uses the `release` preset with apt Qt 6 and
`ctest --preset release` under the offscreen platform; Windows uses MSVC 2022, vcpkg
nlohmann/json and an aqt-installed Qt 6.5.3, then `windeployqt` so the archive runs on a
clean machine. Both stage the existing `install()` rules into `dist/` (desktop, CLI, data
catalogs) and add a `RUN.txt` that repeats the not-yet-validated marker.

Existing `native.yml` push/PR verification is unchanged; packaging is deliberately a
separate workflow so a slow Qt install never sits in the pull-request path. These are
unsigned test builds — installer work still belongs to M7, and no milestone gate is
affected. No engine, model or UI code changed.

**Verification:** workflow YAML parsed locally; the build itself is proven by the CI run,
not by this container, which has neither Qt nor nlohmann/json installed.

### 2026-09-14 — MIT License added

Added a top-level `LICENSE` (MIT, copyright 2026 Warissakorn) and a README License section.
The bundled Noto Sans Thai font keeps its SIL OFL 1.1 terms and Qt keeps its own; the MIT
grant covers this repository's own source and documentation only. No code change.
